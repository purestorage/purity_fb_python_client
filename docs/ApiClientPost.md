Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**max_role** | [**FixedReferenceNoResourceType**](FixedReferenceNoResourceType.md) | The maximum role allowed for ID Tokens issued by this API client. The bearer of an access token will be authorized to perform actions within the intersection of this max_role and the role of the array user specified as the JWT sub (subject) claim. Valid max_role values are readonly, ops_admin, array_admin, and storage_admin. Users with the readonly (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey the state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the ops_admin (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops Admin users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the storage_admin (Storage Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus storage related operations, such as administering volumes, hosts, and host groups. Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and system configurations. Users with the array_admin (Array Admin) role can perform the same operations as Storage Admin users plus array-wide changes dealing with global and system configurations. In other words, Array Admin users can perform all operations. Modifiable | [optional]
