# **login**
> LoginResponse login(api_token)



Log in to the server

### Example 
```python
from purity_fb import PurityFb, rest

fb = PurityFb("10.255.9.28") # assume the array IP is 10.255.9.28
# this is required for versions before Purity//FB 2.1.3 because they only supports self-signed
# certificates. in later versions, this may be unnecessary if you have imported a certificate.
fb.disable_verify_ssl()
my_ca_certificate_file = '/net/ssl/fb_ca_certificate.pem'
try:
    # login to the array with your API_TOKEN
    # use *_with_http_info method to get response header as well as body
    res = fb.authentication.login_with_http_info(API_TOKEN)
    X_AUTH_TOKEN = res[2]['x-auth-token']

    # SSL verification can be turned on later. In order to make a transition from no SSL
    # verification to strict SSL verification easier, you may turn on a "Certificate Optional" mode
    # that SSL supports. This will allow REST calls to succeed without SSL verification when no
    # certificate is provided, but will begin strictly checking the certificate once one has been
    # provided, so that there is no disruption.
    fb.allow_verify_ssl()
    fb.configure_ca_certificate_file(my_ca_certificate_file)
    # enable strict verification once the file is configured.
    fb.enable_verify_ssl()

    # You can also provide the certificate at the same time that you enable strict SSL verification,
    # if you have already confirmed that your certificate is correct.
    fb.enable_verify_ssl(ca_certs_file_path=my_ca_certificate_file)
except rest.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when logging in to the array: %s\n" % e)

# if you provide the path to a CA certificate(s) file on initialization, then SSL verification will
# be enabled by default
secure_fb = PurityFb("10.255.9.28", ca_certs_file_path=my_ca_certificate_file)
try:
    # login to the array with your API_TOKEN
    # use *_with_http_info method to get response header as well as body
    res = secure_fb.authentication.login_with_http_info(API_TOKEN)
    X_AUTH_TOKEN = res[2]['x-auth-token']

    # the CA certificate used for SSL verification can be changed later if desired
    new_ca_certificate_file = '/net/ssl/replacement_fb_ca_certificate.pem'
    secure_fb.configure_ca_certificate_file(new_ca_certificate_file)

    # SSL verification can be turned off later if desired
    secure_fb.disable_verify_ssl()
except rest.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when logging in to the array: %s\n" % e)
```
